# Raft
Raft by Go

We implemented this raft protocol step by step through three homework, A, B and C. Here I only uploaded C, the final finished one. The only changed file is raft\_lab\_c/raft/src/raft/raft.go, though I edited some code in util.go for logging and debugging, which was commented out in the final submission. For more instruction, please refer to raft\_lab\_c/intro.pdf.

You are welcomed to copy mine if you happen to have the same homework project, but I cannot ensure it will pass "test C with race" all the time. The program may go wrong in some extreme cases, which happens less than 1% in my local test.
